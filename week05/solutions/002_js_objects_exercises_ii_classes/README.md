Classes
=======

#### Objective

Repetition is important right? Learn how to initialize objects using classes in JavaScript and understand how to define properties and methods within a class.

#### Instructions

1.  Create a class called `Book`.
2.  The `Book` class should initialize the following properties:
    *   `title`: a string representing the title of the book.
    *   `author`: a string representing the author of the book.
    *   `pages`: a number representing the total pages in the book.
    *   `isRead`: a boolean indicating if the book has been read or not.
3.  Add a method named `summary` to the `Book` class. This method should return a string summarizing the book details in the format:
    *   `"Title: [title], Author: [author], Pages: [pages], Read: [Yes/No]"`.
